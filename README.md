# AQLI Annual Updates

## Purpose

- Serve as a repository of all the figures, underlying datasets and code of all 
  AQLI content, which includes (but is not limited to) annual reports, 
  factsheets and any other reports.

## General Repository Structure

- Each annual update has its own folder and contains all the graph wise datasets, 
  graph wise code and graphs relevant for that update, segregated by type of 
  report (e.g.annual report, factsheets, policy briefs). 

- The code for annual updates is organised as follows- 
  - the folder for current update (format: **year**). The current update is 
    available in the `2024` folder
  - full annual report and factsheet scripts for the latest update
  - **archive** folder where all code relevant to old annual updates can be found

- In the `archive` folder, the full `.Rmd` files for each type of report in a 
  given annual update are present at the root of that annual update folder

- In the **year** folder,  `annual.report` and `factsheets` sub-folders contain 
  all the individual section and figure wise datasets, code, and graph.

- Apart from this the root contains some other important files and
  folders:

  - **R** folder: This folder contains helper scripts and functions that
    can be utilized all across the annual.updates repository. The
    documentation of these functions is auto-generated by `roxygen2` and
    is stored in the **man** folder (also present at the root).

  - Besides this, the root contains the `README` md files,
    **NAMESPACE** file, **DESCRIPTION** file, the **.RProj** (R project
    file), **.Rbuildignore** file (things that R ignores while building
    an R package), **.gitignore** file (things ignored by Git while R
    package is being pushed to Git).
