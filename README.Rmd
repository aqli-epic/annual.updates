# Annual Updates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the annual.updates repository is to:

* Serve as a repository of all the figures and underlying datasets of the AQLI Annual Reports and factsheets.
* Each annual update has its own folder and contains all the datasets, graphs and the code files relevant for that update.
