# AQLI Annual Updates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Purpose

* Serve as a repository of all the figures, underlying datasets and code of all AQLI content, which includes (but is not limited to) Annual Reports, factsheets and any other reports.


## General Repository Structure 
* Each annual update has its own folder (format: **month.year**) and contains all the graph wise datasets, graph wise code and graphs relevant for that update, segregated by type of report (e.g. annual report, factsheets, top.ten.charts.campaign).

* The master `.Rmd` files for each type of report in a given annual update are present at the root of that annual update folder. So, if for the three types of reports are mentioned in the first point, there will be 3 .Rmd files. 

* The root also contains the **month.year** folder which as mentioned in the first point, contains all the individual graph wise datasets, graph wise code and graph, segregated by report type (e.g. annual report, factsheets, top.ten.charts.campaign). 

* Apart from this the root contains some other important files and folders:

    * **R** folder: This folder contains helper scripts and functions that can be utilized all across the annual.updates repository. The              documentation of these functions is auto-generated by `roxygen2` and is stored in the **man** folder (also present at the root).
    
    * Besides this, the root contains the `README` Rmd and md files, **NAMESPACE** file, **DESCRIPTION** file, the **.RProj** (R project           file), **.Rbuildignore** file (things that R ignores while building an R package), **.gitignore** file (things ignored by Git while R        package is  being pushed to Git). 

* Old annual updates can be found in their respective **month.year** folder. There is one folder for each older annual update and within that folder the repository structure is the same as mentioned above for the latest annual update. As of now, the latest report was published in June 2022, that is the first year for which we have data and processes documented on GitHub. But in the coming years, that is the place where all old annual updates content can be found.

* In general, the repository follows the standard R package structure to organize code. At some point, we may convert this into a R package for ease of use.

## Reports published using June 2022, Annual Report data:

* Similar structure as below will be followed in all other annual reports. For each report, the corresponding RMDs can be found in the root of the repo (switch to the apprpriate branch to get the latest version of the RMDs).

* This year we have published our content in types of formats: 
    
    * Annual Report (main global report)
    * Factsheets (region specific factsheets)
    * Top 10 charts campaign (special focus on the top charts of the report)
    
* All of the above content (graph wise) can be found in the **june.2022** folder, which is present at the root of the `annual.updates` repository. Apart from this, all in one report wise content can be accesed in the individual report wise .Rmds which are also present at the root of the `annual.updates` repository.  

* In the **june.2022** folder, there are two other folders that are important. These are:

    *  **master.dataset**: this contains the master color files for different years, especially the latest year. This color file is the             output of the AQLI backend process and is used to make "almost" all calculation in the AQLI reports.
      
    *  **other.important.calculations.data**: This folder contains some other "side" (differentiating them from the main color dataset)             dataset that are used to make certain calculations for the annual report.
    
    
## Reports published using September, 2023, annual report data (coming soon!)

      
## Important Note

* Some of the AQLI backend processes (i.e. the processes that output the color file master dataset) and also some side processes (e.g. GBD calculations that go into some figures) are not yet documented in this repository. But, we plan to add this to the repository in the future.
